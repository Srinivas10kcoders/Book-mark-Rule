        <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ ⓘ; 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian
            aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born
            and
            raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four
            decades
            as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)
            and
            Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme
            and
            military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work
            on
            the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal
            organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
            the
            original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]

            Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya
            Janata
            Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",[6]
            he
            returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a
            recipient
            of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.

            While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an
            apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level dignitaries,
            attended
            the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.[8]

            Early life and education
            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage
            centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His
            father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a
            housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between
            Rameswaram
            and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his
            family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous
            properties
            and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who
            claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved trading groceries between
            the
            mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and
            Pamban.
            With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family
            fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was
            poverty-stricken by
            the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income.
            [19][20][21]

            In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had
            a
            strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics.[21] After completing his
            education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's
            College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics
            in
            1954.[22] He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.[13]
            While
            Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and
            threatened
            to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the
            deadline,
            impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a
            difficult
            deadline."[23] He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in
            qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.[24]</p>

            Srinivasa Ramanujan FRS (/ˈsriːnɪvɑːsə rɑːˈmɑːnʊdʒən/ SREE-nih-vah-sə rah-MAH-nuuj-ən;[1] born Srinivasa
            Ramanujan Aiyangar, Tamil: [sriːniʋaːsa ɾaːmaːnud͡ʑan ajːaŋgar]; 22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920)[2][3] was
            an Indian mathematician. Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial
            contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including
            solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable.

            Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation. According to Hans Eysenck, "he
            tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed for the most part. What he
            had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not
            be bothered".[4] Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work, in 1913 he began a postal
            correspondence with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England.
            Recognising Ramanujan's work as extraordinary, Hardy arranged for him to travel to Cambridge. In his notes,
            Hardy commented that Ramanujan had produced groundbreaking new theorems, including some that "defeated me
            completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before",[5] and some recently proven but highly
            advanced results.

            During his short life, Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900 results (mostly identities and
            equations).[6] Many were completely novel; his original and highly unconventional results, such as the
            Ramanujan prime, the Ramanujan theta function, partition formulae and mock theta functions, have opened
            entire new areas of work and inspired a vast amount of further research.[7] Of his thousands of results, all
            but a dozen or two have now been proven correct.[8] The Ramanujan Journal, a scientific journal, was
            established to publish work in all areas of mathematics influenced by Ramanujan,[9] and his
            notebooks—containing summaries of his published and unpublished results—have been analysed and studied for
            decades since his death as a source of new mathematical ideas. As late as 2012, researchers continued to
            discover that mere comments in his writings about "simple properties" and "similar outputs" for certain
            findings were themselves profound and subtle number theory results that remained unsuspected until nearly a
            century after his death.[10][11] He became one of the youngest Fellows of the Royal Society and only the
            second Indian member, and the first Indian to be elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Of his
            original letters, Hardy stated that a single look was enough to show they could have been written only by a
            mathematician of the highest calibre, comparing Ramanujan to mathematical geniuses such as Euler and Jacobi.

            In 1919, ill health—now believed to have been hepatic amoebiasis (a complication from episodes of dysentery
            many years previously)—compelled Ramanujan's return to India, where he died in 1920 at the age of 32. His
            last letters to Hardy, written in January 1920, show that he was still continuing to produce new
            mathematical ideas and theorems. His "lost notebook", containing discoveries from the last year of his life,
            caused great excitement among mathematicians when it was rediscovered in 1976.

            Early life

            Ramanujan's birthplace on 18 Alahiri Street, Erode, now in Tamil Nadu

            Ramanujan's home on Sarangapani Sannidhi Street, Kumbakonam
            Ramanujan (literally, "younger brother of Rama", a Hindu deity)[12] was born on 22 December 1887 into a
            Tamil Brahmin Iyengar family in Erode, in present-day Tamil Nadu.[13] His father, Kuppuswamy Srinivasa
            Iyengar, originally from Thanjavur district, worked as a clerk in a sari shop.[14][2] His mother,
            Komalatammal, was a housewife and sang at a local temple.[15] They lived in a small traditional home on
            Sarangapani Sannidhi Street in the town of Kumbakonam.[16] The family home is now a museum. When Ramanujan
            was a year and a half old, his mother gave birth to a son, Sadagopan, who died less than three months later.
            In December 1889, Ramanujan contracted smallpox, but recovered, unlike the 4,000 others who died in a bad
            year in the Thanjavur district around this time. He moved with his mother to her parents' house in
            Kanchipuram, near Madras (now Chennai). His mother gave birth to two more children, in 1891 and 1894, both
            of whom died before their first birthdays.[12]

            On 1 October 1892, Ramanujan was enrolled at the local school.[17] After his maternal grandfather lost his
            job as a court official in Kanchipuram,[18] Ramanujan and his mother moved back to Kumbakonam, and he was
            enrolled in Kangayan Primary School.[19] When his paternal grandfather died, he was sent back to his
            maternal grandparents, then living in Madras. He did not like school in Madras, and tried to avoid
            attending. His family enlisted a local constable to make sure he attended school. Within six months,
            Ramanujan was back in Kumbakonam.[19]

            Since Ramanujan's father was at work most of the day, his mother took care of the boy, and they had a close
            relationship. From her, he learned about tradition and puranas, to sing religious songs, to attend pujas at
            the temple, and to maintain particular eating habits—all part of Brahmin culture.[20] At Kangayan Primary
            School, Ramanujan performed well. Just before turning 10, in November 1897, he passed his primary
            examinations in English, Tamil, geography, and arithmetic with the best scores in the district.[21] That
            year, Ramanujan entered Town Higher Secondary School, where he encountered formal mathematics for the first
            time.[21]

            Swami Vivekananda (/ˈswɑːmi ˌvɪveɪˈkɑːnəndə/; Bengali: [ʃami bibekanɔndo] ⓘ; 12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902),
            born Narendranath Datta (Bengali: [nɔrendronatʰ dɔto]), was an Indian Hindu monk, philosopher, author,
            religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna.[4][5] He was a key figure in the
            introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world[6][7][8] and the Father of modern Indian nationalism
            and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, and bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world
            religion.[9]

            Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young age
            towards religion and spirituality. He later found his guru, Ramakrishna, and became a monk. After the death
            of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda extensively toured the Indian subcontinent, acquiring first-hand knowledge of
            the living conditions of Indian people in then British India. Moved by their plight, he resolved to help his
            countrymen and found a way to travel to the United States, where he became a popular figure after the 1893
            Parliament of Religions in Chicago, in which he began his famous speech with the words: Sisters and brothers
            of America... before introducing Hinduism to Americans.[10][11] He was so impactful at the Parliament that
            an American newspaper described him as "an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the
            Parliament".[12]

            After great success at the Parliament, in the subsequent years, Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures
            across the United States, England and Europe, disseminating the core tenets of Hindu philosophy, and founded
            the Vedanta Society of New York and the Vedanta Society of San Francisco (now Vedanta Society of Northern
            California),[13] both of which became the foundations for Vedanta Societies in the West. In India,
            Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math, which provides spiritual training for monastics and householder
            devotees, and the Ramakrishna Mission that provides charity, social work and education.[7]

            Vivekananda was one of the most influential philosophers and social reformers in his contemporary India, and
            the most successful missionaries of Vedanta to the Western world. He was also a major force in contemporary
            Hindu reform movements, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India.[14] He is now
            widely regarded as one of the most influential people of modern India and a patriotic saint. His birthday in
            India is celebrated as National Youth Day.[15][16]

            Early life (1863–1888)
            A Bengali woman, sitting
            Bhubaneswari Devi (1841–1911); "I am indebted to my mother for the efflorescence of my knowledge."[17] –
            Vivekananda
            Vivekananda as a wandering monk
            3, Gourmohan Mukherjee Street, birthplace of Vivekananda, now converted into a museum and cultural centre
            Birth and childhood

            Statue of Vivekananda at the Ramakrishna Mission Swami Vivekananda's Ancestral House and Cultural Centre
            Vivekananda was born as Narendranath Datta (name shortened to Narendra or Naren)[18] in a Bengali
            family[19][20] in his ancestral home at 3 Gourmohan Mukherjee Street in Calcutta,[21] the capital of British
            India, on 12 January 1863 during the Makar Sankranti festival.[22] He belonged to a traditional family and
            was one of nine siblings.[23] His father, Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney at the Calcutta High
            Court.[19][24] Durgacharan Datta, Narendra's grandfather was a Sanskrit and Persian scholar[25] who left his
            family and became a monk at age twenty-five.[26] His mother, Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout housewife.[25]
            The progressive, rational attitude of Narendra's father and the religious temperament of his mother helped
            shape his thinking and personality.[27][28] Narendranath was interested in spirituality from a young age and
            used to meditate before the images of deities such as Shiva, Rama, Sita, and Mahavir Hanuman.[29] He was
            fascinated by wandering ascetics and monks.[28] Narendra was mischievous and restless as a child, and his
            parents often had difficulty controlling him. His mother said, "I prayed to Shiva for a son and he has sent
            me one of his demons".[26]
